# CollegeTimeTable
This project is a timetable for the college, we built it for our "managment of projects" course.
We were asked to split into 2 groups of 4 students each.
The first group was responsible for the admin, secretary and the teaching staff.
The second group was responsible for the students, the dean and the exam faction.

We were working with the agile model with the scrum methodology, using SQL servers for our databases.
This project took alot of time and effort, but eventualy I learnt alot from it.
